### Technologies Used:
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- jquery
- BreweryDB API

### Summary of my app
This application uses the BreweryDB API to help users find new and old beers of all kinds, from Lagers to IPA's. The user can search for beers by name, and view a unique list of beers. The search functionality will return information about each beer including the ABV, whether it is organic or not and a brief description. This will allow the user to see beer options they might not have known about.

Optimized for Cell phones, Tablets and Desktops

### Unresolved Issues
- When attempting to add images to the app, it only displays the beers that have an image in the array, leaving out the beers that dont have a picture. 

- Need to add a local storage to store users 'Wishlist' and 'Favorite' items
