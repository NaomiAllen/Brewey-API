### Technologies Used:
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- jquery
- BreweryDB API

### Summary of my app
This application uses the BreweryDB API https://www.brewerydb.com/developers to help users find new and old beers of all kinds. From Lagers to IPA's. This application presents the user with a unique list of beers given their search option. Allowing the user see the many different styles of that beer, ABV, whether it is organic or not and a breif description of each beer listed. This will allow the user to see beer options they might not have known about.

### Unresolved Issues
- When attempting to add images to the app. It only displays the beers that have an image in the array, leaving out the beers that dont have a picture. 

- Need to add a local storage to store users 'Wishlist' and 'Favorite' items
